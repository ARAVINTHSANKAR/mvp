* Private variables should be begin with underscore '_'
* Common scratch variables for integers are i, j, k, m, n and for character c and d	
* Plural form should be used on names representing a collection of objects
	Collection<Point> points;
	int[] values;
*  n prefix should be used for variables representing a number of objects
	nPoints, nLines
* Method name should be verbs and it begins with lower case
* No space between a method name and the parenthesis 
* class Sample extends Object {
	Sample(int i, int j) {
		ivar1 = i;
	}
 	int emptyMethod() {}
  }
* void connect(Database database) // NOT: void connect(Database db)
* use like this - bool issuccess
* The maximum length of each line is 132 characters. But, ORACLE suggest to avoid lines longer
	than 80 characters.
* longName1 = longName2 * (longName3 + longName4 - longName5)
 + 4 * longname6; // prefer high level breaks
longName1 = longName2 * (longName3 + longName4
- longName5) + 4 * longname6; // Avoid lower-level breaks
* /*
* Here is a block comment.
*/
* int level; // indentation level
int size; // size of table
* Put declarations only at the beginning of blocks. (A block is any code surrounded by curly
braces "{" and "}".) Don't wait to declare variables until their first use; it can confuse the unwary
programmer and hamper code portability within the scope.
